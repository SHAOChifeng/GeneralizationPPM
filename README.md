Can deep neural networks learn process model structure? An assessment framework and analysis

The code used produce the experiments found in the paper can be found here: 
- Grid contains the code used to do the hyperparamater grid search
- Experiment contains the code used to perform the main experiments

Data and pretrained LSTMs can be found here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/f5skxptrbs/1

This repository will be updated and restructured soon!
